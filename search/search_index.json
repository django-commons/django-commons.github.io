There are two main differences. The first is that Django Commons leans into the GitHub paradigm and centers the organization as a whole within GitHub. This is a risk, given there's some vendor lock-in. However, the repositories are still cloned to several people's machines and the organization controls the keys to PyPI, not GitHub. If something were to occur, it's manageable.</p> <p>The second is that Django Commons is built from the beginning to have more than one administrator. Jazzband has been working for a while to add additional roadies (administrators), but there hasn't been visible progress.  Given the importance of several of these projects, it's a major risk to the community at large to have a single point of failure in managing the projects. By being designed from the start to spread the responsibility, it becomes easier to allow people to step back and others to step up, making Django more sustainable and the community stronger.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-each-repository-team-for","title":"What is each repository team for?","text":"<p>There are three teams for each repository.
