There are two main differences. The first is that Django Commons leans into the GitHub paradigm and centers the organization as a whole within GitHub. This is a risk, given there's some vendor lock-in. However, the repositories are still cloned to several people's machines and the organization controls the keys to PyPI, not GitHub. If something were to occur, it's manageable. The second is that Django Commons is built from the beginning to have more than one administrator. Jazzband has been working for a while to add additional roadies (administrators), but there hasn't been visible progress. Given the importance of several of these projects, it's a major risk to the community at large to have a single point of failure in managing the projects. By being designed from the start to spread the responsibility, it becomes easier to allow people to step back and others to step up, making Django more sustainable and the community stronger. What is each repository team for? # There are three teams for each repository. They each have different permissions. [project-name] [project-name]-committers [project-name]-admins The general team [project-name] gives you triage permissions (assign issues, labels, etc). The [project-name]-committers gives you permission to merge pull requests and push to main. They are people who generally maintain the project. The [project-name]-admins gives you permissions to administrate the GitHub repo and release new versions to PyPI. This may be the same group of people that are on [project-name]-commiters. Who can work on a project? # Anyone can fork any project and work on any issue. All projects within Django Commons are community maintained.

These volunteers are organized into teams, each with a specific focus. Relation to the Django Software Foundation # Django Commons is an independent initiative from the Django Software Foundation (DSF). We are here for the third-party packages that complement Django. We are here as a community for and by Django users. Teams # There are four teams that work together to handle the operations of Django Commons. They are: Admin Team CoC Team PyPI Team Security Team Communication # Our teams use two main ways to communicate: GitHub Discussions and team related Google Group email. Quick guide: Use GitHub Discussions for: technical questions, project ideas, general help, and community discussions. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting for: security concerns. Use Google Group email for: personal matters, sensitive information, or private volunteer concerns. We believe in being open and transparent, so we encourage everyone to use GitHub Discussions as their first choice. This public space lets everyone see and join our conversations, which helps new volunteers learn from past discussions and feel included in our community. Admin team # This is the core team that is responsible for the overall management of the organization. They have admin access to the GitHub organization and are responsible for making sure that Django Commons is running smoothly. Responsibilities/tasks include: Manage incoming transfers and outgoing transfers of projects. Manage new membership applications. Respond to inquiries from the community on the Discussion forum . Manage all team rotation schedules, making sure that every team is actively staffed in a sustainable manner. Encourage people from diverse backgrounds to join one of the teams. Provide resources and facilitate projects seeking new or additional maintainers. Help find new maintainers for projects that need them. Facilitate discovery of maintenance best practices. Maintain the django-commons/membership repository. Maintain the django-commons/controls repository. This is the repository that contains the controls for managing Django Commons projects. Conduct check-ins with project maintainers and our community. Maintain this document and other documents that describe how Django Commons operates. Attend regular team meetings to discuss the state of Django Commons and what we can do to improve it. Help organize events and other community activities. Reach out to projects that might be interested in joining Django Commons. Out of scope responsibilities/tasks: Maintaining projects. This is the responsibility of the maintainers of the projects themselves. However, admin team members are free to contribute to projects as they see fit. There is just no expectation that they do so. Qualifications for admin members: Be a DSF Individual Member Contributed 10 discussion topics or comments in the last 6 months that have contributed positively to Django Commons Team governance # The admin team has a minimum of three and a maximum of ten members. The exact number is determined by the admin team from time to time. The size of the admin team should reflect the workload and responsibilities of the team; as the needs of the organization change, the size of the admin team will adjust by vote. (Example: during transition periods, the size of the admin team may need to be larger.) The admin team may change around September. In August, the admin team will put out a public call to its membership to gauge interest in joining the admin team. Based on that interest, the admin team will decide: The size of the admin team for the upcoming term. Whether team changes are needed, or whether some admins can step down to make room for new admins. Which admins will step down, and which will continue to serve. At this time, the process for selecting new admin team members is based around the current admin team interviewing candidates it deems suitable. An election process was considered but as of April 2025, the admin team feels Django Commons has not matured enough for elections to provide tangible benefits over self-selection. We strive to have a team reflective of our values . Means of communication # The admins internally communicate via the django-commons-admin@googlegroups.com mailing list and through admin meetings. The discussion taking place on the mailing list is private and only visible to admin team members. However, the team should aim to operate transparently and use public channels, like posting to GitHub Discussions, when possible. To contact the admin team, open an Admin request issue on the membership repo . You can also publicly tag the @django-commons/admins team on GitHub to get our attention. If you need to reach out privately to the admin team, you can do so by sending an email to django-commons-admin@googlegroups.com. Code of Conduct team # The Code of Conduct team is responsible for handling complaints of Django Code of Conduct violations that occur in the Django Commons community. Responsibilities/tasks include: Investigating and responding to complaints of Code of Conduct violations. Making decisions on how to handle complaints of Code of Conduct violations.

Team governance # The Code of Conduct team has no set rotation schedule. Members can step down at any time and interested parties can reach out to the admin team if they are interested in being part of the code of conduct team. The admin team is responsible for periodically checking in to make sure all members are still okay in continuing their role and is tasked with finding replacements if needed. Admin team members are allowed to be on the Code of Conduct team too if they wish. The preferred size of the Code of Conduct team is 2-5 members. This is to make sure that the workload is distributed evenly and to allow for more diversity of thought and perspective. Means of communication # The Code of Conduct team communicates via the django-commons-coc@googlegroups.com mailing list. PyPI team # The PyPI team is responsible for safeguarding PyPI access to all projects hosted by Django Commons. Responsibilities/tasks include: Managing PyPI access for all projects hosted by Django Commons. Adding and removing users from projects as needed.

The PyPI team has a rotation schedule of 12 months, given the overall low workload and effort required to onboard and offboard members. The team has a preferred size of 2-3 members. This is to balance the number of people with unlimited access to PyPI and the bus factor associated with a small group of people. The rotation schedule coincides with the rotation schedule of the admin team, centered around October 1st as the start of the cycle. This means that the PyPI team is re-staffed after the new admin team is in place. Means of communication # The PyPI team communicates via the django-commons-pypi@googlegroups.com mailing list.
